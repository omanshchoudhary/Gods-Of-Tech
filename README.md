# Gods of Tech 🌐

**An all-in-one hub for tech people — built by a tech person in the making.**

## 🧠 What is this?

A long-term project designed to become the ultimate digital space for developers, builders, and tech enthusiasts.  
It's being built from scratch, while learning, with a clear vision in mind:

- **Unified Dashboard:** Connect and manage all your dev-related accounts (GitHub, Twitter/X, LinkedIn, etc.) in one place.
- **Tech Community Space:** A Twitter-style feed where devs can post, share ideas, and engage.
- **Project Management:** Plan, track, and showcase your projects — solo or in teams.
- **More features coming as the vision grows...**

This is going to be **big**, but I'm starting small. Just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for now — learning and building as I go.

## 🔧 Current Status

> **Learning + Building in public**

This is a personal, long-term project. I'm documenting the entire journey — from not knowing what to build to shipping something real.  
Don’t expect polished code or complete features (yet). Instead, expect honest progress.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Current Phase)

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (vanilla)

In the future, I plan to explore:
- React / Next.js
- Firebase / Supabase
- OAuth integrations
- Database + Auth
- and whatever else this vision demands

---

## 📅 Timeline

- **2025**: Learning, prototyping, building the foundation  
- **2026 and beyond**: Scaling into something real and usable

## 📌 Note to self (and others)

This is more than just a project — it’s the start of something long-term.  
No rush, no fake hype — just consistent effort and real ambition.
